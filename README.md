This project presents a lightweight chat application that utilizes Huffman Coding, a popular data compression algorithm, to minimize the amount of data transmitted during communication. By encoding messages before sending and decoding them upon receipt, the app ensures effective data transmission in scenarios with limited bandwidth, such as mobile hotspots or poor connectivity zones
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters.
To build a text-based chat application that functions efficiently in low-bandwidth environments.
To implement Huffman Coding for message compression to reduce data usage.
To facilitate real-time communication with minimum data loss and delay.
To enhance performance over traditional chat apps in constrained networks.
